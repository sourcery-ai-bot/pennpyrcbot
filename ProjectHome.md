The aim of PyRCBot is to attempt some basic Natural Language Processing. PyRCBot will receive input and respond through IRC. By combining the theory behind basic NLP with network functionality, we plan to develop a chat bot that can hold up a conversation with one to many humans. To achieve this, we first need to study some of the concepts in NLP. Using that, we will continue to refine the bot's ability to "understand" English. Once it is able to derive some meaning from its input text, it will attempt to generate a meaningful response.

> We will be using the third party irclib module to manage the connection to the IRC server. In this portion of the project, networking and socket programming concepts learned in class will also be applied. We will finally attempt to incorporate multithreading when attempting to add functionality in holding up multiple conversations. More information on the irclib module can be found at http://python-irclib.sourceforge.net/.
